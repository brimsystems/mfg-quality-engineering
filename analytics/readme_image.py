"""The dashboard image at the top of the README: docs/readme/dashboard.png.

Usage: python -m analytics.readme_image
The dashboard page is rendered at 1280 px wide with Playwright. The full page is too tall to read at README width, so the image runs from the top of
the page to the end of the second panel: the header, the headline tiles and the first two panels. The page is rendered in the installed Edge or Chrome,
or in Playwright's own Chromium where neither is installed; where no browser is available the committed image is left as it is.
